# GU
The best card game ever

## Development Guidline
* Use Python as the game core and card script engine since it's easy to learn (easy to make core-level modification)
* Do not repeat yourself (e.g. use @get and @set decorator so that we do not need to handle event raising, hooking, etc. explicitly)
